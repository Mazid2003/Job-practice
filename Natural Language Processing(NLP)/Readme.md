# üß† Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This repository contains resources, examples, and projects related to **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** ‚Äî the field of AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

## üìå What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing bridges **human language** and **computer understanding**, combining **linguistics**, **computer science**, and **AI** to process text and speech.

## üîë Key Areas
- **Text Processing** ‚Äì Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop-word removal.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** ‚Äì Extracting names, locations, dates, etc.
- **Sentiment Analysis** ‚Äì Determining emotions or opinions in text.
- **Language Modeling** ‚Äì Predicting or generating sequences of text.
- **Machine Translation** ‚Äì Translating between languages.
- **Question Answering** ‚Äì Building systems that answer user queries.
- **Summarization** ‚Äì Condensing large text into concise summaries.

## üé§ Speech-Related NLP
- **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)** ‚Äì Converting speech to text.
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** ‚Äì Converting text into spoken audio.

## üñºÔ∏è Multimodal NLP
- Models like **CLIP**, **GPT-4V** process both text and images/videos for richer understanding.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethics & Privacy
- **Bias & Fairness** ‚Äì Ensuring AI doesn‚Äôt reinforce harmful stereotypes.
- **GDPR Compliance** ‚Äì Handling and storing personal text/speech data responsibly.

    Use: Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression
    
    Dataset: IMDB Movie Reviews
    
    Goal: Predict whether a review is Positive or Negative.

- Word Cloud Generator

    Use: Text preprocessing, visualization libraries
    
    Dataset: Any text (news articles, tweets, reviews)
    
    Goal: Generate a word cloud showing most frequent words.

- Resume Keyword Extractor

    Use: Regex, spaCy NER
    
    Dataset: Collection of resumes (PDFs / text)
    
    Goal: Extract names, emails, skills, and experience.

### üü° Intermediate NLP Projects

- News Categorization

        Use: TF-IDF + Naive Bayes / SVM
        
        Dataset: BBC News Dataset
        
        Goal: Classify news into categories (Sports, Tech, Business, Politics, etc.).

- Question Answering Bot (Closed Domain)

        Use: BERT / DistilBERT
        
        Dataset: SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)
        
        Goal: Answer questions from a given paragraph/document.

- Named Entity Recognition (NER)

        Use: spaCy / BiLSTM-CRF
        
        Dataset: CoNLL-2003 Dataset
        
        Goal: Extract names, places, organizations from text.

- Fake News Detection

        Use: TF-IDF, LSTMs, or Transformers
        
        Dataset: Kaggle Fake News Dataset
        
        Goal: Classify whether a news article is Real or Fake.

### üî¥ Advanced NLP Projects

Chatbot with NLU + NLG

Use: Rasa, Dialogflow, or Transformers (BERT + GPT)

Dataset: Custom intents dataset or open-source chat datasets

Goal: Build a multi-turn conversational chatbot.

Abstractive Text Summarization

Use: Seq2Seq, Attention, Transformer models (BART, T5)

Dataset: CNN/DailyMail or XSum

Goal: Generate human-like summaries instead of extractive ones.

Machine Translation

Use: Seq2Seq with Attention or Transformer

Dataset: WMT‚Äô14 (English‚ÄìFrench / English‚ÄìGerman)

Goal: Translate text between languages.

Speech-to-Text + Text Analysis Pipeline

Use: Speech Recognition + NLP models

Dataset: LibriSpeech (for audio) + any text dataset

Goal: Convert audio to text, then apply sentiment/NER/QA.

Multi-modal NLP (Vision + Language)

Use: CLIP, BLIP-2, LLaVA models

Dataset: MSCOCO captions

Goal: Build an app that describes images in natural language or answers questions about them.

‚ö° Pro tip: Start with text preprocessing + ML models, then move to deep learning (LSTMs, GRUs), and finally tackle transformer-based NLP (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.).
