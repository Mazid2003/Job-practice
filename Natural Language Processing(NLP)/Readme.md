# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This repository contains resources, examples, and projects related to **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — the field of AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

## 📌 What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing bridges **human language** and **computer understanding**, combining **linguistics**, **computer science**, and **AI** to process text and speech.

## 🔑 Key Areas
- **Text Processing** – Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop-word removal.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – Extracting names, locations, dates, etc.
- **Sentiment Analysis** – Determining emotions or opinions in text.
- **Language Modeling** – Predicting or generating sequences of text.
- **Machine Translation** – Translating between languages.
- **Question Answering** – Building systems that answer user queries.
- **Summarization** – Condensing large text into concise summaries.

## 🎤 Speech-Related NLP
- **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)** – Converting speech to text.
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** – Converting text into spoken audio.

## 🖼️ Multimodal NLP
- Models like **CLIP**, **GPT-4V** process both text and images/videos for richer understanding.

## ⚖️ Ethics & Privacy
- **Bias & Fairness** – Ensuring AI doesn’t reinforce harmful stereotypes.
- **GDPR Compliance** – Handling and storing personal text/speech data responsibly.
