# 🚀 Essential Algorithms for Beginners and Interviews

This repository summarizes 12 must-know algorithms that form the foundation of problem-solving in data structures and algorithms. These are highly useful in coding interviews, competitive programming, and real-world applications.

## 1️⃣ Linear Search
**Purpose:** Search for a target element in an unsorted array by checking each element one by one.

**Use Case:** When the list is small or unsorted.

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)


## 2️⃣ Binary Search
**Purpose:** Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

**Use Case**: Fast search in a sorted list.

- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 3️⃣ Bubble Sort
**Purpose:** Repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the list is sorted.

**Use Case:** Educational, not practical for large datasets.

- Time Complexity: O(n²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 4️⃣ Selection Sort
**Purpose:** Select the minimum element from the unsorted portion and move it to the beginning.

**Use Case:** Simple to understand, but inefficient for large datasets.
- Time Complexity: O(n²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 5️⃣ Insertion Sort
**Purpose:** Build the final sorted array one item at a time by shifting elements.

**Use Case:** Efficient for small or nearly sorted data.

- Time Complexity: O(n²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 6️⃣ Merge Sort
**Purpose:** Divide the array, sort the halves recursively, and then merge them.

**Use Case:** Stable and efficient for large datasets.
**Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)**

## 7️⃣ Quick Sort
**Purpose:** Select a pivot, partition the array around it, and recursively sort partitions.

**Use Case:** Fast and widely used; may degrade to O(n²) in worst case.

- Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average
- Space Complexity: O(log n) (due to recursion)

## 8️⃣ Two Pointers Technique
**Purpose:** Use two pointers to solve problems in linear time, such as finding pairs or palindromes.

**Use Case:** Searching in sorted arrays, string problems, etc.

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 9️⃣ Sliding Window Technique
**Purpose:** Maintain a window of elements and slide it to efficiently compute values like max sum.

**Use Case:** Subarray problems, average/max/min in window.

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 🔟 Kadane’s Algorithm
**Purpose:** Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

**Use Case:** Dynamic programming problem for subarray sums.

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Prefix Sum & Difference Arrays
**Purpose:** Precompute cumulative values for fast range queries.

**Use Case:** Fast subarray sum, range updates.

- Time Complexity: O(n) preprocessing, O(1) query
- Space Complexity: O(n)

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Flood Fill Algorithm (DFS/BFS)
**Purpose:** Fill all connected cells of the same color/region in a grid.

**Use Case:** Grid-based problems, image editing tools (like paint bucket).

- Time Complexity: O(m × n)
- Space Complexity: O(m × n) (due to recursion or queue)
