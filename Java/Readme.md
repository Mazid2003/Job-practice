# Java Overview
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is one of the most widely used programming languages for building robust, secure, and platform-independent applications.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features

- **Platform Independent:** "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

- **Object-Oriented:** Supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for modular and reusable code.

- **Robust & Secure:** Strong memory management, exception handling, and built-in security features.

- **Multithreaded:** Allows concurrent execution of two or more threads for high-performance applications.

- **Rich API & Libraries:** Provides a vast standard library and a strong ecosystem of third-party tools.

## ðŸ”¹ Common Use Cases

- **Enterprise-level applications** (via Spring, Hibernate)

- **Android app development** (via Android SDK and Kotlin/Java integration)

- **Web applications and backend systems**

- **Big Data** (using Hadoop, Spark bindings)

- **Scientific computing and embedded systems**
