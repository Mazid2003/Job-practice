# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of efficient problem-solving in computer science. They help you write optimized code that performs well in terms of time and space complexity, which is crucial for real-world applications and competitive programming.

## 🔹 What is a Data Structure?
A Data Structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that operations like access, insertion, deletion, and search can be performed efficiently.

### ✅ Common Data Structures:

| Category       | Examples                         | Description                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Linear**     | Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue | Store elements sequentially               |
| **Non-Linear** | Tree, Graph, Heap, Trie          | Hierarchical or interconnected data       |
| **Hash-Based** | HashMap, HashSet                 | Provide fast access using key-value pairs |

## 🔹 What is an Algorithm?
An Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a specific problem in a finite amount of time.

### ✅ Types of Algorithms:

**Searching Algorithms** – Linear Search, Binary Search

**Sorting Algorithms** – Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort,Insertion Sort, Selection Sort

**Recursion & Backtracking** – Factorial, N-Queens

**Greedy Algorithms** – Activity Selection, Coin Change

**Dynamic Programming (DP)** – Fibonacci, Knapsack

**Graph Algorithms** – BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s

**Divide and Conquer** – Merge Sort, Binary Search

## 🧠 Why Learn DSA?

## 📈 Time and Space Complexity

Understanding Big O Notation is key to evaluating algorithm efficiency:

- O(1) → Constant Time

- O(n) → Linear Time

- O(log n) → Logarithmic Time

- O(n^2) → Quadratic Time
