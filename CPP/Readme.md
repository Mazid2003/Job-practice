# 🚀 C++ Programming Overview

Welcome to my C++ Programming Repository! This repository is a collection of concepts, projects, and fundamental ideas related to one of the most powerful and widely-used languages in the programming world — C++.

# 🔷 What is C++?
C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, making it ideal for system/software development, game engines, real-time simulations, embedded programming, and more.

Developed as an extension of the C language, C++ includes advanced features like classes, inheritance, templates, exception handling, and the Standard Template Library (STL).

# 🛠 Tools and Environment
- IDEs like Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion

- GCC or Clang compilers

- C++17/20 standard support for modern features

- Command-line tools and debuggers for practice

# 🎯 Why Learn C++?
- Offers fine-grained control over system resources

- Forms the base of many other programming languages

- Widely used in game development, finance, high-performance computing, embedded systems, and competitive programming

- Helps strengthen core programming logic and understanding
