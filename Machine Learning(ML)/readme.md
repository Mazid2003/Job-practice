# 🤖 Machine Learning

This folder contains resources, notes, and materials related to **Machine Learning (ML)** — a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data to make predictions or decisions.

Machine Learning is categorized into:
- **Supervised Learning** – learns from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning** – identifies patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning** – learns by interacting with an environment to maximize reward.

📄 All detailed explanations, algorithms, evaluation metrics, workflows, and examples are included in the attached PDF inside this folder.
