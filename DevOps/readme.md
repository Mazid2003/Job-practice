# 🚀 DevOps Overview

DevOps is a culture and set of practices that bring **development (Dev)** and **operations (Ops)** teams together to deliver applications faster, more reliably, and at scale.  
It focuses on **automation, collaboration, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD)** to achieve high-quality software releases.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **CI/CD** – Automating build, test, and deployment pipelines.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Managing infrastructure using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation.  
- **Containers & Orchestration** – Using Docker & Kubernetes for scalable, portable applications.  
- **Monitoring & Logging** – Ensuring system health with Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, etc.  
- **DevSecOps** – Embedding security into every stage of the pipeline.  
- **Cloud & Scalability** – Leveraging AWS, Azure, GCP for elastic infrastructure.  

## 🎯 Why DevOps?
- Faster software delivery  
- Improved collaboration  
- Better scalability & reliability  
- Reduced risks with automation  
- Continuous feedback & improvement
